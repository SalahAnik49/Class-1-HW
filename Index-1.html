<p>  Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Thursday it had uncovered an
     American espionage operation that compromised thousands of iPhones using
     sophisticated surveillance software.
<br>
     Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab said dozens of its employees’ devices were
     compromised in the operation.
    <br>
     The FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said in a statement that
    several thousand Apple Inc devices had been infected, including those of
    domestic Russian subscribers as well as foreign diplomats based in Russia and
    the former Soviet Union.
    “The FSB has uncovered an intelligence action of the American special services
    using Apple mobile devices,” the FSB said in a statement.
    <br><br>
    The FSB said the plot showed “close cooperation” between Apple and the
    National Security Agency (NSA), the US agency responsible for cryptographic
    and communications intelligence and security. The FSB provided no evidence
    that Apple cooperated with, or had any awareness of, the spying campaign.
    <br><br>
    In a statement, Apple denied the allegation. “We have never worked with any
    government to insert a backdoor into anyApple product and never will,”
    the firm said in a statement.
    The NSA declined to comment.
                              <br><br>
    Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky said on Twitter that dozens of his employees’
    phones were compromised in the operation, which his company described as
    “an extremely complex, professionally targeted cyber-attack” that had targeted
    workers in “top and middle-management.”
                    <br><br>
    Kaspersky researcher Igor Kuznetsov told Reuters that his company had
    independently discovered anomalous traffic on its corporate Wi-Fi network
    around the start of the year. He said Kaspersky did not circulate its findings to
    Russia’s Computer Emergency Response Team until earlier on Thursday.
    He said he could not comment on Moscow’s allegation that Americans were
    responsible for the hacking or that thousands of others had been targeted.
    <br><br>
    “It’s very hard to attribute anything to anyone,” he said.
    <br><br>
    In a blog post, Kaspersky said the oldest traces of infection it discovered dated
    back to 2019. “As of the time of writing in June 2023, the attack is ongoing,” the
    company said. It added that while its staff was hit, “we are quite confident that
    Kaspersky was not the main target of this cyber-attack.”</p>

    <h2>US Snooping?</h2>
    <br>
 <p>The United States is the world’s top cyber power in terms of intent and
    capability, according to Harvard University’s Belfer Center Cyber 2022 Power
    Index, followed by China, Russia, the United Kingdom and Australia.
        <br><br>
    Both the Kremlin and Russia’s foreign ministry pointed to the significance
    of the matter.
    <br>    <br>
    “The hidden data collection was carried out through software vulnerabilities in
    US-made mobile phones,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement.</pre>
